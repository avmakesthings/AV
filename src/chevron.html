            <h3 class="centered">The Question</h3>
            <h6 class="mt">Traditional architecture starts from the premise that architectural structures are singular and fixed . . . Emergence requires that the opposite is true – that those structures are complex energy and material systems that have a lifespan, exist as part of an environment of other active systems, and develop in an evolutionary way.</h6> 
            <h3 class="text-right small">– Michael Weinstock</h3>
            <p class="mt">Many architectural theorists and visionaries, from Peter Cook to Michael Weinstock have speculated about future of the built environment.  One direction, favoured by proponents of automated or interactive environments such as Michael Fox, errs towards creating buildings that are dynamic and responsive i.e. able to reconfigure and evolve based on input or requirement. Culturally and historically, though we have viewed our buildings and cities as static entities, kinetic architecture could enable our built environments to become ecosystems that more closely emulate the natural world.    
            </p>
            <p class="mt">From a technical standpoint, we are starting to see the emergence of technology that could facilitate this vision, such as the Kilobots (Harvard School of Computer Science) or Spatial Robots (Miles Kemp). These projects utilize the aggregation and proliferation of a single component to create self-organizing, kinetic forms.  What if through similar tectonics, we were able to generate the interactive architecture conceived by futurists?     
            </p>
            <p class="mt">It was this question that Jordi Truco, principal of HybridA, a research office based in Barcelona that develops responsive architecture, posed to our research studio at UC Berkeley.  With this as an overarching goal, we attempted to generate self-supporting surfaces that could alter form or reconfigure based on specified stimuli, through the aggregation and proliferation of identical modules.

            <p>The Material Intelligence research studio veered from the conventional process of standard architectural pedagogy and focused upon the development of a single component as opposed to an entire building. Working together with Ash Low and Win Mixter, we explored the capabilities of a single module, the chevron, investigating the performance of the form under different conditions.  
            </p>
            <p>My role on the project included: Design, Component prototype R&D, Developing the digital model, Digital Fabrication, Arduino programming, Material testing, 3d Visualization, Motion graphics

              <h6 class="mt">Materials </h6>            
              <p>We were also limited by our access to certain materials. All of the initial development was done with paper and digitally, which is an excellent way to rapidly test different ideas.  However, as we progressed to other plastics and metal films, we were limited by what we could safely use at the institution e.g. no PVC or coated carbon fiber.   
              </p>
              <h6 class="mt">Kinematics  </h6>             
              <p>Given that no one on our team had a robotics background, developing kinematics was probably the most difficult part.  While we were all skilled in digital fabrication, kinematics is not typically needed in architectural modeling.  Consequently, we had some difficulty calculating resistance factors for the various materials we tried and a lot of manual calibration was required which may not have been necessary with some mechanical engineering expertise.  
              </p>
              <p>For me this really highlighted the necessity of working on multi disciplinary teams and while we often received input from engineers, it really didn’t come close to the kind of multi-disciplinary collaboration that I’ve seen in other projects I’ve worked on.

            <p>More or less the entire six-month duration of this project was spent on R&D, where we initially worked to define individual modules and document their performative capabilities. These explorations in scale, material and structure progressed to research into proliferated modules. Through our research, we went back and forth between developing digital and physical models, which entailed a rigorous process of building physical models, measuring deformations and inputting records into the code we developed in an attempt to predict how modules would behave if proliferated on a mass scale. </p>

              <h6>Component design</h6>
              <p>Starting with a base shape, the chevron, our team iterated through hundreds of different adjustments to the form, looking for the optimal size and dimensions for proliferation.  Part of this initial research phase also involved developing mechanisms for connection.  The development of our digital model also began here, with a single component and it’s deformations being modeled using rhino and grasshopper, a graphical algorithm editor.</p>

            <p>Once we had defined a base module, we started exploring how it would behave when proliferated.  Understanding this behavior became the driver for further refinement of the component and the various connections we were developing.  It was also necessary to then start modeling the behavior of the proliferated components and grouping them into modules that could be used to generate a surface.  We used Matlab to mathematically define each module and then built these into our digital model.  </p>

              <p>After much initial testing, we built an actuated, 1:1 scale demonstrator model to test the operational logic and mechanics of the system.  The demonstrator was controlled using an Arduino and actuated through the use of servos. Through our earlier modeling, we discovered that the motion of our modules created varying degrees of porosity and thought that this may be useful to modulate light penetration.  The model was therefore built to be photosensitive and we tested a range of PIR sensors with it.</p>

            <p>The Material Intelligence research studio was a really interesting opportunity to investigate and propose novel ways to define and build structural surfaces.  It was also my first experience of an R&D project that was really more grounded in mechanical engineering or industrial design than architecture, which forced me to learn new tools and skills.  It is exciting to know that the work we did, especially given its academic context, feeds into greater discourse surrounding this topic.  This is the kind of preliminary research that should be more widely disseminated in architectural pedagogy as the implications, or rather possibilities for architectural practice are as exciting as the notion of autonomous environments.
