            <h3 class="centered">An introduction of sorts</h3>
            <p class="mt">Last year, the San Francisco Department of Public Works counted 16,164 incidents of streets and sidewalks that needed cleaning, the majority of which concerned human waste (SFDPW).  As anyone who lives here will tell you, San Francisco has a problem! Add to this mess the recent statewide water restrictions and things start to compound fast.   
            </p>
            <p class="mt">In early 2012, shortly after I started working there, Hyphae Design Laboratory released their Tenderloin Toilet Masterplan. The proposal was the product of a yearlong participatory design process that incorporated town-hall meetings, drop-in hours and extensive surveys of the neighbourhood residents and resources. The proposed concept design aimed to apply ecological principles to address the neighbourhoods ongoing urban sanitation problems.  Based on this study, the City of San Francisco awarded Hyphae and the North of Market- Tenderloin Community Benefit District (Nom-TL CBD) a Community Challenge Grant to fund the design and construction of SF’s first public composting toilet.  
            </p>
            <h5 class="mt">100% of Google survey respondents are upset about the amount of human waste found on streets/sidewalks.</h5>
            <h3 class="text-right small"> --Public Toilet Project Masterplan, Hyphae Design Lab</h3>           

            <p class="mt">As we began working through conceptual design for the toilet, the need to field test materials and systems became increasingly necessary. We also found ourselves speculating a lot on usage, as there were so many uncertainties in trying to predict what typical interaction would be, let alone edge cases. So we applied for a grant through the Urban Prototyping festival to try and test a number of aspects of the design and thus PPlanter 1.0 was born.   
            </p>
            <p class="mt">Over the past few years, we’ve designed, built and installed 3 iterations of the PPlanter in various locations around SF, with the purpose of acquiring insight into the way people perceive and use public toilets in San Francisco.  Each field test has taught us valuable information about everything from spatial configuration to signage and has been invaluable to the design and development of the larger toilet project.  Yes… more toilets.

            <p>I’ve worked on many aspects of this ongoing project, from its inception to the present. The PPlanter is a project of Hyphae Design Lab and always has been the collaborative product of a multi disciplinary team of people, both Hyphae employees and volunteers.  Again this whole project has been funded through various grants and the majority of the work has been pro bono – a civic duty of sorts.

    <!-- ********** MAIN CONSTRAINTS ********** -->

        <div class="container"> 
          <div class="row mt ">
            <h3 class="centered">The Major Constraints</h3>
            <p class="mt">There really were so many issues and constraints but I’ve listed some of the key ones below:</p>
            <h6 class="mt">Predicting use</h6>
            <p>While we all had a pretty good idea of the motions an average user goes through when ... ah using the bathroom, it was surprisingly difficult to accurately predict how people would use the prototype. We had considered affordances throughout the design process of each iteration, with the aim of fostering intuitive use.  Discovering what aspects of the design needed further explanation provided interesting insight into human behavior and user experience. One of the hardest challenges was the attempt to make it gender neutral, which to date hasn’t been really successful. 
            </p>
            <h6 class="mt">Mitigating the needs of users vs other invested parties </h6>
            <p>Really not an easy thing to do when considering the privacy a pregnant woman may desire with the degree of visibility the police department demanded.  As always though, the design challenges were really what made the project interesting to work on and to rework over and over again.  
            </p>          
            <h6 class="mt">Finding installation locations </h6>
            <p>Given that everyone in San Francisco seems to know what goes on in public street restrooms here, an unsurprising few were willing to have one installed outside their business. It was only through the support of organizations like the Tenderloin National Forest, Glide and YWAM that we were able to install and monitor street trials. Permitting was also a challenge, but that was mainly just a lengthy process each time. 
            </p>
            <h6 class="mt">Monitoring trials </h6>
            <p>Finding participants to monitor the street trials was also a challenge. We were fortunately able to recruit some of the homeless people in the area to assist in monitoring the installation and discovered an unforeseen amount of stewardship from the homeless community.  
            </p>
            <h6 class="mt">Getting consistent feedback  </h6>
            <p class="mb">Due to the prior two issues, it was difficult generate the most rigorous trial situations. We ultimately had to reconcile ourselves to larger margins of error in some cases, however these were often overcome by testing the same thing many different ways and correlating feedback.

            <p class="mt">As is typically the case with projects like this, that have so many invested parties and such ambitious goals, the design process has been a lengthy and highly collaborative one.  Over the past 3 years we have designed and redesigned, built and rebuilt the project many times over.  There have been 3 official versions but we’ve done a lot of prototyping in between.  Each iteration has built on the last and allowed us to test new fabrication techniques, materials and design assumptions. </p>

            <p>We realized that while the basic function of the PPlanter was clear, there were many unfamiliar aspects to the design, especially for women.   People were often not sure if it was something they could actually use because it was aesthetically so different from a typical street facility.

            <p>So we’ve definitely discovered some interesting things along the way… like women are far more likely to use it late at night, especially if they’re inebriated and with a friend. That people try and steal plants and that monitoring is totally necessary.. Overall however the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, an indication that the underlying problem is still very much an issue. Hopefully we’ll have something out on the streets more permanently in the next year.
